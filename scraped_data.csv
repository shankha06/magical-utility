Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd. The use of the Internet pages of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject. The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to A Buchanan Contractors Ltd. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled. As the controller, A Buchanan Contractors Ltd has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone. Definitions The data protection declaration of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used. In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms: a) Personal data Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. b) Data subject Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing. c) Processing Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. d) Restriction of processing Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future. e) Profiling Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. f) Pseudonymisation Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law. h) Processor Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. i) Recipient Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. j) Third party Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data. k) Consent Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. Name and Address of the controller Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is: A Buchanan Contractors Ltd Woodlands Farm, Wood Street Village Guildford, Surrey, GU3 3DU United Kingdom Phone: 01483 237066 Email: andrew@abc-group.com Website: https://www.abc-group.com Cookies The Internet pages of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser. Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID. Through the use of cookies, A Buchanan Contractors Ltd can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting. By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system. The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable. Collection of general data and information The website of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems. When using these general data and information, A Buchanan Contractors Ltd does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, A Buchanan Contractors Ltd analyses anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject. Registration on our website The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller. By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject—date, and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution. The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller. The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. A Data Protection Officer particularly designated in this data protection declaration, as well as the entirety of the controller’s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons. . Contact possibility via the website The website of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd contains information that enables an electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to. If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements. Rights of the data subject a) Right of confirmation Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. b) Right of access Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information: the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations; where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing; the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source; the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. c) Right to rectification Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten) Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary: The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed. The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR. The personal data have been unlawfully processed. The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR. If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by A Buchanan Contractors Ltd, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data Protection Officer of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd or another employee shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately. Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. The Data Protection Officer of the Greaves Design Ltd or another employee will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases. e) Right of restriction of processing Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by A Buchanan Contractors Ltd, he or she may at any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data Protection Officer of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd or another employee will arrange the restriction of the processing. f) Right to data portability Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact the Data Protection Officer designated by A Buchanan Contractors Ltd or another employee. g) Right to object Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions. A Buchanan Contractors Ltd shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. If A Buchanan Contractors Ltd processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to A Buchanan Contractors Ltd to the processing for direct marketing purposes, A Buchanan Contractors Ltd will no longer process the personal data for these purposes. In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by A Buchanan Contractors Ltd for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may directly contact the Data Protection Officer of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd or another employee. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications. h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject’s explicit consent. If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject’s explicit consent, A Buchanan Contractors Ltd shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision. If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may at any time directly contact our Data Protection Officer of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd or another employee of the controller. i) Right to withdraw data protection consent Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time. If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may at any time directly contact our Data Protection Officer of A Buchanan Contractors Ltd or another employee of the controller. Legal basis for the processing Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR). The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favour of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders. Period for which the personal data will be stored The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfilment of the contract or the initiation of a contract. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data. Existence of automated decision-making As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.

Search open Request a sample Terms and Conditions of Sale 1. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. “Advancion” means Advancion Corporation, a Delaware corporation with its headquarters located at 1500 E. Lake Cook Road, Buffalo Grove, Illinois 60089 U.S.A., or any of its direct or indirect foreign subsidiaries or other Affiliates. “Customer” means the purchaser of Product(s) from Advancion under these Terms. “Price” means the price set by Advancion for a Product. “Product” means any product sales specifications to which these Terms apply. 2. ADVANCION’S COMMITMENTS. The Product when shipped will meet Advancion’s then current Product sales specifications (“Specifications”), and Advancion will convey the Product with good title, free from any lawful lien or encumbrance. Advancion will notify Customer if the Specifications are changed. Advancion will supply Customer with current safety data sheets (“SDS”). 3. CUSTOMER’S COMMITMENTS. (a) Taxes. Customer will pay all taxes and duties that are increased or levied, now or in the future, in connection with the manufacture, sale, transportation, use or disposal of the Product. (b) Payments/Credit. Unless there is a contract signed by Advancion or purchase order acknowledgment to the contrary, Customer will pay to Advancion the Price for the Product(s) net 30 days from invoice date. Time of payment is of the essence. If (1) Customer does not pay on time or (2) Customer’s financial responsibility becomes unsatisfactory and Advancion deems itself insecure, then Advancion may defer shipments, accelerate the due date on all amounts owed Advancion, require cash payments or other security and/or terminate these Terms, in each case without liability and without waiving any other remedies Advancion may have against Customer. Customer agrees to pay all of Advancion’s collection costs, including prompt payment of reasonable legal fees and costs. Advancion may charge Customer the maximum interest allowed by law on all overdue amounts. (c) Responsible Practices. Customer will (i) be solely responsible for determining the suitability of Product in Customer’s formulations and applications prior to use; (ii) familiarize itself with any product literature or information Advancion provides under Advancion’s product stewardship program, including the SDS for each Product; (iii) adopt and follow safe and appropriate handling, storage, transportation, use, treatment and disposal practices with respect to the Product, and the containers thereof, including such special care and practices as Customer’s use of the Product requires including, without limitation, all such practices required by federal, state and local government statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances; (iv) provide appropriate warnings to and instruct its employees, independent contractors, agents and customers of the precautions and safe use practices required in connection with the unloading, handling, storage, use, treatment, transportation and disposal of the Product, and the containers thereof, including without limitation information contained in Advancion’s most current SDS; and (v) comply with applicable health, safety, security and environmental laws, and take action necessary to avoid spills or other dangers to persons, property or the environment. Advancion may immediately suspend Product shipments and/or terminate these Terms on fifteen (15) days’ notice if Customer fails to comply with any of its commitments under this subsection. (d)Inspection. Customer shall promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or commingling, inspect Product shipments for any damage to packaging, shortage or non-conformance to these Terms. All claims for damage to packaging, shortage or non-conformance which could reasonably be discoverable in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless Customer notifies Advancion in accordance with Section 8. (e) Indemnity. Customer will indemnify and hold Advancion harmless for all claims, damages and related costs, including prompt payment of reasonable legal fees and costs, arising out of Customer’s noncompliance with any of its commitments under subsection c) and d) above. (f) No Reselling. Customer understands and acknowledges that it is not engaged as a distributor, reseller, repackager, or relabeler of the Product(s), and that any distributing, reselling, repackaging, or relabeling the Product(s) by Customer is prohibited, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Advancion. 4. CHANGES TO TERMS. Advancion may increase Price, change transportation terms, change payment terms, and/or change the notice provision, by giving Customer at least fifteen (15) days’ prior notice. These changes will be deemed accepted unless Customer objects in writing before the effective date of the change. Advancion shall advise Customer within fifteen (15) days from receipt of timely written objection from Customer whether Advancion shall: (a) continue to supply Product on terms and conditions in effect prior to the announced change; (b) enter into negotiations with Customer; or (c) delete affected Product from these Terms. If Advancion elects to enter into negotiations as allowed under b) above, and if, within thirty (30) days from the date of Advancion’s notice of change, a written agreement between the parties has not been reached and Advancion has not agreed to continue to supply on the terms and conditions in effect prior to the announced change, then either party may, upon written notice to the other party, terminate the negotiations and delete the affected Product from these Terms. Unless otherwise agreed in writing as part of the negotiations, price and other terms applicable during the negotiating period shall be those which Advancion implemented by its initial notice. A Temporary Voluntary Allowance (“TVA”), from the current Price of any Product may be instituted, changed, or withdrawn by Advancion at any time, with or without notice, and shall not be deemed a change of Price. 5. FORCE MAJEURE / EXCUSED PERFORMANCE. Performance is excused when (a) there is any contingency beyond the reasonable control of Advancion or Customer including, for example, war or hostilities, acts of God, accident, fire, explosion, public protest, breakage of equipment, pandemic, government shutdown or shelter-in-place order from any governmental authority, acts of terrorism, activity of a governmental authority (including, for example, the passage of legislation or the failure to grant an export license), or labor difficulties and/or labor strikes which interferes with Advancion’s or Customer’s production, supply, transportation or consumption practice; or (b) Advancion is unable to obtain raw materials, power or energy on terms Advancion deems commercially acceptable. During times when performance is excused, all quantities of affected Product will be eliminated from these Terms without liability and Advancion will allocate its supplies of raw materials and Product among their various uses in any manner that Advancion determines is fair and reasonable in its sole discretion, but these Terms will otherwise remain in effect. Advancion will not be obligated to obtain raw materials, intermediates, or Product from other sources, or to allocate raw materials, intermediates, or Product from Advancion’s internal use. The foregoing provisions do not relieve Customer of its obligation to timely pay in-full a Product invoice. 6. EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES. THE WARRANTIES IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF SECTION 2 ABOVE ARE ADVANCION’S SOLE WARRANTIES RESPECTING PRODUCT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PRODUCT QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE, AND ARE MADE EXPRESSLY IN LIEU OF AND EXCLUDE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES PROVIDED BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE. 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES. NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND ADVANCION’S TOTAL LIABILITY, FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY AND TORT) ARE LIMITED TO CUSTOMER HAVING THE OPTION OF REPLACEMENT OR REPAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE PRODUCT WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM(S). CUSTOMER ASSUMES ALL RISKS AND LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THE PRODUCT SUPPLIED UNDER THESE TERMS. 8. NOTICE OF CLAIMS. ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO QUALITY, QUANTITY, WEIGHT, CONDITION, AND LOSS OR DAMAGE TO THE PRODUCT CONTAINED IN ANY DELIVERY, AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, WILL BE WAIVED BY CUSTOMER UNLESS MADE IN WRITING TO ADVANCION WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER EITHER (a) TENDER OF DELIVERY TO, AND REFUSAL TO ACCEPT DELIVERY BY, CUSTOMER, (b) ACCEPTANCE OF DELIVERY BY CUSTOMER, (c) THE DATE(S) SPECIFIED FOR DELIVERY, OR (d) THE DATE ON WHICH CUSTOMER BECOMES AWARE, OR SHOULD BECOME AWARE, OF THE FACTS ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED, WHICHEVER SHALL OCCUR OR APPLY IN ADVANCION’s SOLE DISCRETION. 9. ASSIGNMENT. (a) These Terms are not transferable or assignable by either party without prior written consent of the non-assigning party except that Customer hereby consents, without further notice from Advancion, to Advancion’s potential future assignment or delegation of (i) some or all of Advancion’s obligations hereunder to any Affiliate, in which case the Affiliate may effect delivery of the Product and invoice Customer directly, or (ii) these Terms and all of Advancion’s rights and obligations hereunder, on a product-by-product basis, to any Affiliate. (b) In the event Customer transfers its business involving Product under these Terms, through a sale or transfer of stock or assets, the new owner(s), as a condition of the sale or transfer and subject to Advancion’s express written consent pursuant to Section 9(a), shall be obligated by Customer to assume all of Customer’s obligations under these Terms relating to the affected Product. (c)”Affiliate” means with respect to any entity, any other entity directly or indirectly owning, owned by, or under common ownership with, such entity; for purposes of this definition, “owning”, “owned” and “ownership” shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of an ownership interest, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, of at least fifty percent (50%) as a result of ownership of stock or other voting securities, contractual relationship or otherwise. (d) If these Terms are assigned in accordance with Sections 9(a) or 9(b), all of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. 10. SHIPPING/TRANSFER OF TITLE/RISK OF LOSS. (a) The shipping terms contained in any sales contract signed by Advancion or purchase order acknowledgment for the Product shall govern with respect to transfer of title and risk of loss of such Product from Advancion to Customer. However, the following shipping terms shall apply only if the sales contract or purchase order acknowledgement is silent on shipping terms. For overland shipments, Product will be delivered, and title and risk of loss shall transfer to Customer in accordance with INCOTERMS 2020 FCA Advancion’s shipping facility. For overseas shipments, Product will be delivered, and title and risk of loss will pass, to Customer in accordance with the INCOTERMS 2020 CIF when delivered on board the ship by Advancion. (b) Unless otherwise directed by Customer, Customer agrees that Advancion shall select the carrier and pre-pay the freight and insurance, which shall be charged to Customer plus an administrative fee. Unless specified otherwise, Customer is responsible for clearance of the Product through customs at the port of destination, along with all duties, taxes and fees in connection therewith. (c) Unless otherwise specified in a sales contract signed by Advancion, or purchase order acknowledgement, title to Product shall be deemed to pass concurrently with delivery in accordance with the applicable INCOTERMS 2020 designation. Delivery times are approximate and are dependent upon prompt receipt by Advancion of all information necessary to proceed with the work without interruption. If Products delivered do not correspond in quantity, type or price to those itemized in the shipping invoice or documentation, Customer shall so notify Advancion within ten (10) days after receipt. 11. ADVANCION INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Customer acknowledges that all formulations, trademarks and copyrights relating to the Products are the property of Advancion. Customer shall not take any action that infringes upon any trademark, copyright, patent, or other intellectual property of Advancion. In addition, Customer shall not use any trademark of Advancion on or in relation to any product not originating from Advancion. Customer shall not use any trademark of Advancion on or in relation to any Product which Customer repacks or re-labels for resale (with Advancion’s written permission pursuant to Section 3(f)) without obtaining written authorization from Advancion, specifying the terms and conditions of such use. If Customer uses any product trademark of Advancion in any price list, advertisement or product literature, Customer shall identify the trademark as a “Trademark of Advancion Corporation (‘Advancion’) or an affiliated company of Advancion.” 12. GENERAL. (a) In the event of any conflict between any terms in this document and in any sales contract signed by Advancion or purchase order acknowledgement, the terms of such sales contract or purchase order acknowledgment shall prevail. Except for the foregoing, however, this document, together with its attachments and addenda, constitutes the complete and final agreement between Customer and Advancion regarding Product, and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, as to the subject matter herein. This document may be modified only by a written amendment, expressly stated as such, signed by both parties. (b)This Agreement is executed in English. In the event this Agreement is translated into a language or languages other than English, this version in English shall be controlling on all questions or interpretations and performance. (c) The rights and obligations under Sections 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 will survive the cancellation, termination or expiration of these Terms. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold Advancion harmless from and against all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, those related to injury to or death of Customer’s employees, and including prompt payment of reasonable legal fees) arising from or connected with any third party claims related to injury to or death of any person or persons, or damage to or loss of property in any way arising from or connected with the possession, handling, processing or use of the Product(s) by Customer, except those resulting solely from the use of Product(s) not conforming to the contracted Specifications, which non-conformity was not known to Customer. (e) The failure of a party to exercise its rights on one occasion, including the obligation to supply Product, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to exercise those rights in the future. (f) If any provision of these Terms is declared invalid by any court or government agency, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. (g) Each party represents and warrants that it understands and shall comply with the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions under which each party is or may be acting hereunder. (h) These Terms will be governed by the law of the country from which the Advancion invoice originates (“Governing Law”) without reference to its principles of conflict of laws. Additionally, Advancion and Customer hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction, for any lawsuit arising out of these Terms, in any court located in a major city of the country of the Governing Law that is closest to the applicable Advancion principal or registered office (“Jurisdiction”). The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna, 11 April 1980) or any successor thereto is expressly excluded, unless a court of competent jurisdiction in the country in which the lawsuit is brought prohibits these Terms from being governed by the Governing Law, in which case these Terms will be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or any successor thereto. The Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods, as well as the Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, is expressly excluded. (i) Customer agrees to comply with all export laws of the country from which the Product originates (“Advancion’s domicile”) and all import laws of any country having jurisdiction over Customer or the transactions contemplated by these Terms. (j) Advancion is subject to application of the export control laws of Advancion’s domicile. In this capacity Advancion may be prohibited from directly or indirectly exporting and/or selling products, or allowing third parties to directly or indirectly sell or export products, into certain embargoed countries and to certain restricted or denied customers under the export control laws of Advancion’s domicile. Prohibited transactions include any transaction in which Product(s) are shipped to or through the embargoed countries or which involve the restricted or denied customers. Customer shall not directly or indirectly, sell or export the Product(s) to any of these embargoed, restricted or denied persons, entities or countries, nor sell or otherwise transfer any such Product to any customer under circumstances where it has knowledge or reason to believe that the Product will be sold or exported to any such embargoed, restricted or denied person, entity or country. The Customer further certifies that, to the best of its knowledge, the Product sold and delivered by Advancion will not in any way be used for purposes that are prohibited under national and international regulations. (k) Shipping and delivery dates are approximate and are given by Advancion in good faith, but are not guaranteed. Customer shall be responsible for all storage and other costs relating to Customer’s failure to accept delivery pursuant hereto.
